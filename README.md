This (someday) may be 3rd version of my [Twitch bot](https://github.com/Abev08/TwitchBot).  
There was an attempt to create it in [Rust](https://github.com/Abev08/twitch_bot_v3) but the project is abandoned (for now).

This time I don't want any config files - everything will be stored in SQL database (probably SQLite).  
Also it should be browser based - native window will be repalced by http config pages.
